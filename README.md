<br>My name is Maurice, I am _passionate_ about the digital field. I studied Public Affairs & Communication.
Now, I am open to learn coding in order to acquire new skills in the digital sector. Because it would help me to realize some professional projects. 
I like **cooking and outdoor activities**. I am from Cameroon.<br>
